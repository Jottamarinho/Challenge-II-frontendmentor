# Challenge-II-frontendmentor
<h1>Stats preview card component page<h1> 
<p>the challenge of the day was to create this Stats preview card component page, the project started a long time ago and can only finish this week. I suffered with some lack of guidance to finalize the project, mainly in the marking of class definition and in the responsibility of the sizes for the devices.
<br>
Responsiveness has been one of my biggest concerns so far.</p>
